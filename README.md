# MSF Infrastructure Automation
This repository is for the automation of various MSF infrastructures such as QA, UAT, PreProd etc.

For this automation, we used 2 open-source tools - packer and terraform.

### Packer
[Packer](https://packer.io/) is used for building the images for bahmni installer.

### Terraform
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is used to create, manage, and update various relevant AWS infrastructure resources (such as EC2, S3, Route53 etc.) for the different environments.
